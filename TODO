== nearest version


== next versions

 * minimize running external programms. Just once run `git status --porcelain`
   and parce the output
 * add command line parameter --ignore_missing_paths
 * output detailed info about what branch has changes
 * show ok if some path is missing and there are params --ignore_missing_paths
   --show_ok
 * maybe I should not store lib/App/IsGitSynced.pm in git repo because it is
   generated from the script? and maybe I can remote that file. The same
   question about README, but it is needed for pretty view in github.
